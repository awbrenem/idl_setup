Installing all the necessary tools to use IDL software for the UMinn space physics group.



TDAS (aka SPEDAS, aka spdsw)    http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/socware/bleeding_edge/
The “bleeding edge” is the nightly build, and is the most up to date version. You may only need to update
every year or so, so you’ll be fine with the most recent one (“spdsw_latest.zip”) for quite a while.
The tricky part with this one is going to be getting IDL to know where these programs are located. On Macs I
do this by modifying my .bash_profile file. But, that’s for UNIX. You may want to ask Jackson how to do this
on a Windows machine.


NASA’s CDF library. https://spdf.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/cdf36_4/
In the “idl” or “idl86” folder (depending on which IDL version you have) grab the idl_cdf.dlm file. This file is OS-independent.
There’s also an OS-dependent file called idl_cdf.dll. It’s in the idl86/windows/?? folder.
The documentation should explain where to place these files. That’s all you need to do here.

NAIF SPICE library. Used for calculating satellite trajectories. https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html
You’ll almost certainly want the 64 bit Windows version. This is also an easy install and the README file is
helpful. There are a bunch of files in the downloaded zip folder, but, like the CDF library, I think you only need the
icy.dlm and icy.dll files. I recall that they go in the same folder as the CDF library ones.

IDL GEOPACK   http://ampere.jhuapl.edu/code/idl_geopack.html   (brace yourself for an awesome retro website!)
Download version 9.4 for Windows. Again, we need the .dlm and .dll files (idl_geopack.dlm and idl_geopack.dll)
and I think you place them in the same location as before.



Finally, modify the .bash_profile to start IDL so it recognizes the TDAS routines. 
On my computer I create a function call in my .bash_profile with this code:


# Set up TDAS for the RBSP bleeding edge software
function rbsp {
    unset IDL_PATH
    # export TDAS_UMN=$HOME/Desktop/code/themis_idl
    export TDAS_UMN=$HOME/Desktop/code/Aaron/RBSP/TDAS_trunk_svn
    export CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE=/Applications/exelis/idl84/bin/CDFLeapSeconds.txt
    export IDL_PATH=':+$HOME/Desktop/code/Aaron/rbsp/:+/Applications/exelis/idl84/lib:+/Applications/exelis/idl84/examples/doc/utiliti$
    idl
}
